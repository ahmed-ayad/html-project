<h3>Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0 - 4.0.4</h3>
<h4>
Android Ice Cream Sandwich is the fourth major version of the Android mobile operating system developed by Google. Unveiled on October 19, 2011, Android 4.0 builds upon the significant changes made by the tablet-only release Android Honeycomb, in an effort to create a unified platform for both smartphones and tablets.<br>
Android 4.0 was focused on simplifying and modernizing the overall Android experience around a new set of human interface guidelines. As part of these efforts, it introduced a new visual appearance codenamed "Holo", which is built around a cleaner, minimalist design, and a new default typeface named Roboto. It also introduced a number of other new features, including a refreshed home screen, near-field communication (NFC) support and the ability to "beam" content to another user using the technology, an updated web browser, a new contacts manager with social network integration, the ability to access the camera and control music playback from the lock screen, visual voicemail support, face recognition for device unlocking ("Face Unlock"), the ability to monitor and limit mobile data usage, and other internal improvements.<br>
Android 4.0 received positive reviews by critics, who praised the cleaner, revamped appearance of the operating system in comparison to previous versions, along with its improved performance and functionality. However, critics still felt that some of Android 4.0's stock apps were still lacking in quality and functionality in comparison to third-party equivalents, and regarded some of the operating system's new features, particularly the "face unlock" feature, as being gimmicks.<br>
As of April 2020, statistics issued by Google indicate that 0.2% of all Android devices accessing Google Play run Ice Cream Sandwich
</h4>

<h3>elly Bean 4.1 - 4.3.1</h3>
<h4>
Android Jelly Bean is the codename given to the tenth version of the Android mobile operating system developed by Google, spanning three major point releases (versions 4.1 through 4.3.1). Among the devices that run Android 4.3 are the Asus Nexus 7 (2013) and the LG Nexus 4.<br>
The first of these three releases, 4.1, was unveiled at Google's I/O developer conference in June 2012. It focused on performance improvements designed to give the operating system a smoother and more responsive feel, improvements to the notification system allowing for expandable notifications with action buttons, and other internal changes. Two more releases were made under the Jelly Bean name in October 2012 and July 2013 respectively, including 4.2—which included further optimizations, multi-user support for tablets, lock screen widgets, quick settings, and screen savers, and 4.3—which contained further improvements and updates to the underlying Android platform.<br>
Jelly Bean versions are still supported by Google Play Services. As of September 2020, 0.46% of Android devices run Jelly Bean.
</h4>

<h3>KitKat 4.4 - 4.4.4</h3>
<h4>
Android 4.4 "KitKat" was officially announced on September 3, 2013. The release was internally codenamed "Key lime pie"; John Lagerling, director of Android global partnerships, and his team, decided to drop the name, arguing that "very few people actually know the taste of a key lime pie". Aiming for a codename that was "fun and unexpected", his team pursued the possibility of naming the release "KitKat" instead. Lagerling phoned a representative of Nestlé, who owns the Kit Kat brand and produces the confectionary (outside the United States, where it is produced by The Hershey Company under license), and quickly reached a preliminary deal for a promotional collaboration between the two companies, later finalized in a meeting at Mobile World Congress in February 2013. The partnership was not revealed publicly, or even to other Google employees and Android developers (who otherwise continued to internally refer to the OS as "KLP"), until its official announcement in September.[3][4]<br>
As part of the promotional efforts, Kit Kat bars in the shape of the Android robot logo were produced, while Hershey ran a contest in the United States with prizes of Nexus 7 tablets and Google Play Store credit.[4][5]<br>
The Nexus 5, developed by LG Electronics, was unveiled on September 30, 2013, as the launch device for KitKat.[6]<br>
Up to October 2017, Android 4.4 was still supported with security patches by Google for the source code.

<h3>Lollipop 5.0 - 5.1.1</h3>
<h4>
Android Lollipop (codenamed Android L during development) is the fifth major version of the Android mobile operating system developed by Google and the 12th version of Android, spanning versions between 5.0 and 5.1.1.[4] Unveiled on June 25, 2014 at the Google I/O 2014 conference, it became available through official over-the-air (OTA) updates on November 12, 2014, for select devices that run distributions of Android serviced by Google (such as Nexus and Google Play edition devices). Its source code was made available on November 3, 2014. It is the fifth major update and the twelfth version of Android.<br>
One of the most prominent changes in the Lollipop release is a redesigned user interface built around a design language known as Material Design, which was made to retain a paper-like feel to the interface. Other changes include improvements to the notifications, which can be accessed from the lockscreen and displayed within applications as top-of-the-screen banners. Google also made internal changes to the platform, with the Android Runtime (ART) officially replacing Dalvik for improved application performance, and with changes intended to improve and optimize battery usage.<br>
Android Lollipop was succeeded by Android Marshmallow, which was released in October 2015.[5]<br>
As of October 2020, 1.21% of Android devices run Lollipop 5.0 (API 21), and 3.98% run Lollipop 5.1 (API 22), with a combined 5.19% of usage share.
</h4>

<h3>Marshmallow 6.0 - 6.0.1</h3>
<h4>
Android Marshmallow (codenamed Android M during development) is the sixth major version of the Android operating system and the 13th version of Android. First released as a beta build on May 28, 2015, it was officially released on October 5, 2015, with the Nexus devices being the first to receive the update.<br>
Marshmallow primarily focuses on improving the overall user experience of its predecessor, Lollipop. It introduced a new permissions architecture, new APIs for contextual assistants (first used by a new feature "Now on Tap" to provide context-sensitive search results), a new power management system that reduces background activity when a device is not being physically handled, native support for fingerprint recognition and USB-C connectors, the ability to migrate data and applications to a microSD card, and other internal changes.<br>
As of October 2020, less than 6% of Android devices use this version,[5] and when it was warned that a billion users use this (or older) version, by then no longer supported with security updates,[6] was when 40% used those versions. Since then at least 70% of the users of those old versions have upgraded to a newer version.
</h4>

<h3>Nougat 7.0</h3>

<h4>
Android Nougat (codenamed Android N during development) is the seventh major version and 14th original version of the Android operating system. First released as an alpha test version on March 9, 2016, it was officially released on August 22, 2016, with Nexus devices being the first to receive the update. The LG V20 was the first smartphone released with Nougat.<br>
Nougat introduces notable changes to the operating system and its development platform, including the ability to display multiple apps on-screen at once in a split-screen view, support for inline replies to notifications, and an expanded Doze power-saving mode that restricts device functionality once the screen has been off for a period of time. Additionally, the platform switched to an OpenJDK-based Java environment and received support for the Vulkan graphics rendering API, and seamless system updates on supported devices.<br>
Nougat received positive reviews. The new app notification format received particular praise; while the multitasking interface was seen as a positive change, reviewers experienced that several apps were incompatible with the feature. Critics had mixed experiences with the Doze power-saving mode, but faster app installs and tweaks to the user interface were also reviewed positively.<br>
As of 2021, 7.25% of Android devices run Nougat (no longer receiving security updates), with 4.26% on Android 7.0 and 2.99% using Android 7.1.[4] Relatively higher proportion is using those versions on tablets than on smartphones.
</h4>

<h3>Oreo 8.0</h3>
<h4>
Android Oreo (codenamed Android O during development) is the eighth major release and the 15th version of the Android mobile operating system. It was first released as an alpha quality developer preview in March 2017 and released to the public on August 21, 2017.<br>
It contains a number of major features, including notification grouping, picture-in-picture support for video, performance improvements, and battery usage optimization, and support for autofillers, Bluetooth 5, system-level integration with VoIP apps, wide color gamuts, and Wi-Fi Aware. Android Oreo also introduces two major platform features: Android Go – a software distribution of the operating system for low-end devices – and support for implementing a hardware abstraction layer.<br>
As of February 2021, 14.21% of Android devices run Oreo, with 4.75% on Android 8.0 (API 26 Unsupported) and 9.46% using Android 8.1
</h4>

<h3>Pie 9.0</h3>
<h4>
Android Pie, then referred to as "Android P", was first announced by Google on March 7, 2018,[4] and the first developer preview was released on the same day.[5] The second preview, considered beta quality, was released on May 8, 2018.[6] The third preview, called Beta 2, was released on June 6, 2018.[7] The fourth preview, called Beta 3, was released on July 2, 2018.[8] The final beta of Android P was released on July 25, 2018.[9]<br>
On August 6, 2018, Google officially announced the final release of Android 9 under the title "Pie", with the update initially available for current Google Pixel devices, and releases for Android One devices and others to follow "later this year". The Essential Phone was the first third-party Android device to receive an update to Pie, notably coming day-and-date with its final release.[10][11] The Sony Xperia XZ3 was the first device with Android Pie pre-installed.
</h4>

<h3>Android 10 10.0</h3>
<h4>
Google released the first beta of Android 10 under the preliminary name "Android Q" on March 13, 2019, exclusively on their Pixel phones, including the first-generation Pixel and Pixel XL devices where support was extended due to popular demand.[4] Having been guaranteed updates only up to October 2018, the first-generation Pixel and Pixel XL devices received version updates to Android 10. The Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL were included, after being granted an extended warranty period which guaranteed Android version updates for them for at least 3 years from when they were first available on the Google Store.[5][6] A total of six beta or release-candidate versions were released before the final release.[7][8]<br>
The beta program was expanded with the release of Beta 3 on May 7, 2019, being made available on 14 partner devices from 11 OEMs; twice as many devices compared to Android Pie's beta.[9] Beta access was removed from the Huawei Mate 20 Pro on May 21, 2019 due to U.S. government sanctions,[10] but was later restored on May 31.[11]<<br>
Google released Beta 4 on June 5, 2019 with the finalized Android Q APIs and SDK (API Level 29).[12] Dynamic System Updates (DSU) were also included in Beta 4. The Dynamic System Update allows Android Q devices to temporarily install a Generic System Image (GSI) to try a newer version of Android on top of their current Android version. Once users decide to end testing the chosen GSI image, they can simply reboot their device and boot back into their normal device's Android version.[13]<br>
Google released Beta 5 on July 10, 2019 with the final API 29 SDK as well as the latest optimizations and bug fixes.[14] Google released Beta 6, the final release candidate for testing, on August 7, 2019.
</h4>

<h3>Android 11 11.0</h3>
<h4>
Android 11 was intended for three monthly developer preview builds to be released before the first beta release, initially due in May, with a total of three monthly beta releases before the actual release. A state of "platform stability" was planned for July 2020, and the final release occurred on September 8, 2020.<br>
The first developer preview build of Android 11 was released on February 19, 2020 as a factory image for supported Google Pixel smartphones (excluding the first-generation Pixel and Pixel XL). Developer Preview 2 was then released on March 18,[12] followed by Developer Preview 3 on April 23.[13] On May 6, Google released an unexpected Developer Preview 4, as they pushed the whole roadmap for Android 11 forward a month, setting the date for the first beta for June 3.[14]<br>
The release of the first public beta was originally set to take place on June 3 at Google I/O, which was ultimately canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, an online release event being planned instead.[15] Following the George Floyd protests, Google announced that the release of the first Android 11 beta would be postponed.[16] Beta 1 was finally released on June 10, 2020,[17] followed by Beta 2 on July 8.[18] A hotfix Beta 2.5 was then released on July 22,[19] with Beta 3 released on August 6.[20] It was released on September 8, 2020
